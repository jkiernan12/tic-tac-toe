## Abstract
This was our first opportunity to tackle a project from start to finish with no formal guidance, challenging our technical abilities and project management skills at the same time. I created multiple classes to handle the data model of the game, and created a main.js file to handle interactions with the DOM. I also took it upon myself to use some seasonally appropriate flair to spice up the app's visuals. Recognizing the importance of mobile-friendly layouts, I used media queries to craft multiple responsive layouts for the app.

## Technologies
- Javascript 
  - Classes
  - DOM manipulation
- CSS
    - BEM Naming Convention
    - Media queries
    - Grid & Flexbox
- HTML5
  - Semantic tags
- Chrome
  - Dev tools
  - WAVE Evaluation Tool

## Instructions
- The app can be accessed [here](https://jkiernan12.github.io/tic-tac-toe)!
- Player 1 starts the game and chooses a square to place their token.
- Player 2 and player 1 swap turns until one of them gets three in a row and the game resets.
- If you leave and return to the page, player scores will be retrieved from local storage.

## Features
- Class-to-class interactions for maintaining and updating the data model
- A separate main.js file for rendering and updating the DOM
- A responsive CSS layout that supports mobile users
- Data persistence using local storage
- Seasonal flair (can you guess what holiday is coming up?)

## Potential Improvements
- CSS animations for wins, placing of tokens, etc
- Play against the computer
- Choose your own token
